        <h1>About Turbo Trend</h1>
	    <h2><em>The tool that marketers have been missing.</em></h2>
		<p>With the rise of social media and its widespread adoption by the masses, the marketing landscape has shifted.
           Where your primary focus may have been traditional television, radio, billboard and newspaper advertising, 
           social media presents a whole host of new challenges and opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>Since around 2006, we've seen a steady rise in the number of social media users amassing followings of hundreds of
           thousands and even millions of others - a level of popularity that was previously reserved for beloved 
           celebrities and the biggest brands.  Where celebrity endorsements may have been part of your marketing plan 
           in the past, in 2019, 'celebrities' are scattered across the Internet, in the form of social media 'influencers' 
           that have taken full advantage of the global stage that is the social media landscape. 
        </p>
        <p>Five minutes on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram or Twitter will expose you to an influencer of some description
           monetising their content as their own personal brand with like and follower counts you can only dream of collecting
           organically on your own content.  That is, until you tap into the influencer market with your product or service and
           suddenly, you align your brand with a personality that people trust (think celebrity endorsements, but where the
           celebrity feels like a personal friend), reach thousands to millions of people (many of whom exist within your target
           market segments if you choose your influencer carefully), and improve your brand image and recognition through the
           latest channels.
        </p>
        <p>It's easy to get lost in navigating the online world, especially if you don't have hours to sift through posts
           and profiles until you find a personality that you'd like to align with, but <strong>this is where TurboTrend comes
           in.</strong>
